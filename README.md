I got to brush up on both my CSS skills and JS in one go with this one! ðŸ˜„ Some key learning points were;

- I learned about an input type called `range` which appears as a slider and has a minimum, maximum, and default value.
- I learned more about the `data-` attribute and accessed it through `.dataset` in my function to update the CSS variable with JS.

- I also faced a little challenge of the slider not updating the image real-time while I had the console open. I battled this problem for a short while and even chatGPT 
  couldn't figure it out. Eventually, after some Google searching I came across a Stackoverflow answer and someone pointed out it was a Chrome devtools thing. As soon as I 
  closed dev tools the `mousemove` event listener worked as intended! ðŸ˜†
